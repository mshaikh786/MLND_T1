    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most 50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied\n",
    "   - GaussianNB: Classification of data into class probablities. E.g. emai as spam or non-spam based on the presence of the onehot keys.\n",
    "   - SVM: image recognition, pattern recognition\n",
    "   - RandomForest: Recommendation system based on interests as features.\n",
    "* What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "   - GaussianNB: Easy to use and are computationally fast. Does not require knowlegede of dependency of variables over one another.\n",
    "   - SVM: models complex relationship well. Use less tarining data.\n",
    "   - RandomForest: Its quick. The random selection of features and making running several decision trees to average the performance also gives an opportunity to quantify which features are not important. Its easy to implement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "   - GaussianNB: it assumes all variables are independent of each other. This means it can have low quality of predictions if the is inherent dependency amongst variables. It is also susceptible to outliers in the data.\n",
    "   - SVM: Computationally expensive. \n",
    "   - RandomForest: Prone to overfitting when there are large number of features. This however can be tunned by optimizing decision tree parametes like max_depth, max_sample_split etc..  \n",
    "   \n",
    "* What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "   - All three models can be used for classifying and regression. All three of them are robust against outliers and do well with skewed data. They can handle the number of features in the dataset. Some of them may require tuning to avoid underfitting/overfitting."

    "The three algorithms selected for implementation where uses with default hyperparameters and no tuning was applied. Using defaults, GaussianNB more or less underfits the data, as shown by low Accuracy and Fscore on all sample sizes. GaussianNB had quick solution time for all sample sizes. Out of SVM and RandomForest, SVM was most computationally expensive. However when comapring the F score on training and testing data, this metric has convered for training and testing for SVM better whereas RandomForest is tending to overfit the data (hyperparameter tuning may be required). Although, SVM takes time to completion, specially for 100% sample size, the reported results are more reliable. The underfitting of GaussianNB and overfitting of RandomForest suggest that there is bit of non-linear relationship between features. \n",
    "Having said all that, SVM's computational expense is a bit off-putting. RandomForest did very well in training but did not do as well in testing, suggesting overfitting with default hyperparameters. Given it was signifiantly fasters and has equivalent Fbeta Score as SVM, I would go for tuning RandomForest classifier a bit further to optimize for performance. "

    "Except education-num and age, none of the other expected features appear in the ranking of feature importance of the model. Looking at the feature weight, their isn't a big difference between the values of first i.e. marital_status_Married-civ-spouse and age. The Cumulative effect however, due to each differs significantly. marital_status_Married-civ-spouse and captial-gain adds most to the cumulative feature weight whereas education-num, marital_status_Never-married and age combined add less to cumulative feature weight. Thus both marital_status_Married-civ-spouse and captial-gain are the most significant of these five top features. Both these features have potential to increase the gross household income of a house. In the first case, both husband and wife or other adults sharing the same household could be earning, bringing the gross income well above 50K. Similarly, capital gain from an investment like real estate, i.e. rental property investment or commerical property, can also potentially increase the gross income of a household.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
